# Rust basics
This repository is me trying to learn Rust through doing challenges from [the little book of programming challenges](bookofprogrammingchallenges.pdf) (Original source can be found [here](https://community.computingatschool.org.uk/files/130/original.pdf))

Where possible, I try to use idiomatic Rust. Since I'm learning, that won't always be possible so expect some of the earlier challenges to be a bit of spaghetti!

### Resources for learning Rust
  - [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html)
  - [Official Rust docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html)
  - [Crate docs](https://docs.rs/)

### Some neat packages I use
  - chrono
  - rprompt
  - promptly
  - dialoguer

> I use the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor with the [ide-rust](https://atom.io/packages/ide-rust) package. I use the nightly toolchain to stay on top of new features while also adding support for newer packages.
